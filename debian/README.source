Bundled copy of gtk-doc
-----------------------

Until there is a gtk-doc release with
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-doc/-/merge_requests/30 merged, we need
to use gtk-doc from the gtk-doc-for-gtk4 git branch to document GTK 4.

Check out an appropriate commit from upstream git, build a tarball with
"meson dist", put it next to the orig.tar.xz for GTK 4 itself and rename
it to gtk+4.0_${VERSION}.orig-gtk-doc-for-gtk4.tar.xz before importing a
new upstream version ${VERSION}.
